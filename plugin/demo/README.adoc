= The Demo Project
Doc Writer <jacobibanez@jacobibanez.com>
:toc:

This folder is a Godot project that you can directly open in Godot 4.2 to see an implementation of the plugin in a real Godot game.

IMPORTANT: To use this project, you have to uncompress the contents of the `addons.zip` file in the link:https://github.com/Iakobs/godot-play-game-services/releases[releases section] of the repository to the root folder of the project.

== Directory Structure
The demo project contains a `scenes` folder with all the `.tscn` and `.gd` files that you will need, everything is inside this folder.

You have sub folders for every feature of the plugin, e.g. `achievements` for displaying the achievements of the game or `snapshots` for the save/load game functionalities.

== Running the project
IMPORTANT: Make sure that you are using version 4.2+ of Godot. This plugin is only for version 4.2 or higher.

This is an android project with a custom build, so in order to run your game from the Godot editor, you have to install the build template first. Please, refer to the https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/android_gradle_build.html[Godot docs] for further information.

You also have to create an `Export Configuration` for Android. Refer to the https://github.com/Iakobs/godot-play-game-services#export-configuration[README] of the repository.

Finally, you can not run the game as a normal game. Instead, you have to run it in an android device (real or emulated) via the `Remote Debug` button in the top right corner of the Godot editor.

== Signing In
The first thing the project does is checking if the user is authenticated, and if not, calls the `sign_in` method of the plugin.

.MainMenu.gd
[source,gdscript,linenums]
----
func _ready() -> void:
	SignInClient.user_authenticated.connect(func(is_authenticated: bool): # <1>
		if not is_authenticated:
			SignInClient.sign_in()
	)
    # ... more code ...
----

<1> The plugin itself calls the `initialize()` method when creating the Autoloads, which checks if the user is authenticated and emits the `user_authenticated` signal, that's why we subscribe to it here.

If the user is successfully signed in, you will see the Sign In animation displayed on top of the screen:

image::screenshots/main_menu/main_menu.png[alt=Screenshot of the main menu with the Signed in animation displayed on top,title=Main Menu showing a user logged in.,width=298,align=center]

IMPORTANT: If the user is not signed in, any of the following features *WON'T* work.

== Screens

Now you will find a description of all the screens that you can navigate from the main menu. You can always go back to the main menu with the `Back` button in every sub-screen.

=== Achievements Screen
image::screenshots/achievements/achievements_screen.png[alt=Screenshot of the achievements screen,title=The achievements screen.,width=298,align=center]

In the achievements screen you will see a `Show Achievements` button and a scrollable list of the achievements of the game. Depending on the type of the achievement, you will see another button underneath every achievement to *reveal*, *unlock* or *increment* the achievement.

The `Show Achievements` button opens a new window provided by Google with the list of achievements for the game, but you can only click on them to see a detailed description.

image::screenshots/achievements/show_achievements.png[alt=Screenshot of the screen provided by google, with a list of achievements,title=The achievements screen provided by google.,width=298,align=center]

Closing that window by swiping it down, you will be back at the achievements menu. The loading of the achievements inside the scrollable section, happens in the `Achievements.gd` script.

.Achievements.gd
[source,gdscript,linenums]
----
func _ready() -> void:
	if _achievements_cache.is_empty():
		AchievementsClient.load_achievements(true) # <1>
	AchievementsClient.achievements_loaded.connect( # <2>
		func cache_and_display(achievements: Array[AchievementsClient.Achievement]):
			_achievements_cache = achievements
			if not _achievements_cache.is_empty() and achievement_displays.get_child_count() == 0:
				for achievement: AchievementsClient.Achievement in _achievements_cache: # <3>
					var container := _achievement_display.instantiate() as Control
					container.achievement = achievement
					achievement_displays.add_child(container)
	)
    # ... more code ...
----
<1> If the cache is empty, we call the `load_achievements` method of the plugin.
<2> We subscribe to the `achievemets_loaded` signal to receive the achievements.
<3> For every achievement, we instantiate an `AchievementDisplay.tscn` file and we feed it the achievement. Then, we add the control as a child of the scrollable section.

In the `AchievementDisplay.gd` script, you will find the code with the logic to *reveal*, *unlock* or *increment* a specific achievement, depending on its type and state.

=== Leaderboards Screen
image::screenshots/leaderboards/leaderboards_screen.png[alt=Screenshot of the leaderboards screen,title=The leaderboards screen.,width=298,align=center]

This screen has a `Show Leaderboards` button at the top, and a scrollable list of the leaderboards of the game. Sames as with the achievements screen, the button will open a new screen provided by Google where you can see the leaderboards and interact with them.

Every item in the scrollable list has options to:

* Submit a score to the leaderboard.
* Display a specific variant of that leaderboard, based on it's time span and collection type.

The code that manages all of this behaviour, can be found in the `LeaderboardDisplay.gd` script.

=== Players Screen
image::screenshots/players/current_player.png[alt=Screenshot of the players screen,title=The players screen.,width=298,align=center]

In this screen you can see information about players of Play Game Services.

The `Search Players` button will open a new screen provided by google where you can find other players by their username. If you select them, they will appear in the Players Screen with a button to compare them. This button will open a new window provided by Google where you can compare this player to the signed in player, and also send an invitation to become friends.

The following screenshots show the process:

.Searching and comparing players.

a|image::screenshots/players/compare_player.png[alt=Screenshot of players screen, showing the searched player]
a|image::screenshots/players/send_invite.png[alt=Screenshot of the screen provided by google to compare players]
|===

Under the `Search Players` button, you have a section with the current signed in player, and below it, another section with a list of the friends of the current signed in player.

Again, same as with the Achievements screen and the Leaderboards screen, you have a `Players.gd` script that controls the screen, and a `PlayerDisplay.gd` script that manages the logic for every individual player card.

=== Saved Games Screen
image::screenshots/snapshots/save_game.png[alt=Screenshot of the saved games screen,title=The Saved Games screen.,width=298,align=center]

This screen presents a simple menu to load and save games. To save a game, fill the form with a file name, a description and some data to save. When all fields are filled, the `Save Game` button will be enabled and you can save your game.

Pressing the `Load Saved Games` will open a new screen provided by Google with the list of saved games for this game and player.

image::screenshots/snapshots/show_saved_games.png[alt=Screenshot of screen provided by google, with a list of the saved games,title=The Saved Games screen provided by Google.,width=298,align=center]

When you click on `Select`, the contents of the saved game will fill the forms in the previous screen.

The code for this screen is all in the `Snapshots.gd` script.

== Troubleshooting
In order to ease the troubleshooting process, the main menu of the app uses the title at the top to display common error messages.

=== Plugin not found
If the plugin is not found, the title will display this text: #Plugin Not Found!#

=== Signing in
If the user is not signed in, the game automatically tries to sign them in with a retry mechanism.

While trying to sign in, the title will display the #Trying to sign in!# text. After the maximum number of retries (5), if the user wasn't logged in, it will display this text: #Sign in attemps expired!#.

In this case, you should look at the logs of the application. Doing so with Android Studio's logcat is easier. Use this regex to filter the logs: `package:com.jacobibanez.godot.test.game package:com.google.android.gms`
